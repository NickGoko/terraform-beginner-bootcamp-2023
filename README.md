## Week 0 Prerequisite Week & Project Prep

- **Why Terraform**

Learning Terraform is crucial for :cloud: cloud engineers because it empowers them to provision and manage cloud resources as code. 

This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach ensures consistency, scalability, and efficiency in cloud deployments. 

Terraform's versatility and support for multiple cloud providers make it a valuable skill for automating infrastructure and orchestrating complex cloud environments, ultimately streamlining operations and reducing manual errors.

. **Codeblocks**

> This code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used to define AWS resources that will be created or managed by [Terraform](/https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/introduction/) <sup>[1]</sup>

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Change to your preferred AWS region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name" # Choose a unique name
  acl    = "private"              # Access control settings
}
```
